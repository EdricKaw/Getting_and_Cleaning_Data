1) CodeBook.md describes the variables, data and transformation of work performed to clean the data.
2) run_analysis.R explains the steps and preparation as per course work:
- a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each      subject.
3) FinalData.txt is the exported final data resulted from the cleansing and transformation steps mentioned in 2).
